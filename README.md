# Miso Bread Sample Repo

This is a sample repository for the IASGE user experience interviews. The content will be about the science of miso bread.

Miso bread is like sourdough but made with miso paste, yeast, and flour.
In 2015, Ben Wolfe published a recipe and tasty description of miso bread [on Lucky Peach](https://web.archive.org/web/20150630225024/http://luckypeach.com/recipes/miso-sourdough-bread/):

- _sourness and other earthy flavors come from the overnight fermentation with the miso._

- _Unpasteurized, naturally-produced misos have many bacteria and yeasts in them that are similar to the bacteria and yeast found in established sourdough starters._

- _The boost of activity from the miso microbes adds a sour flavor from the lactic acid bacteria and also helps create a very beautiful chewy texture._

- _The unpleasant flavors transform into something that ends up tasting like a cross between dark chocolate and pumpernickel in the final baked loaf._

This is a no-knead bread, which means the baker (you!) do not have to knead the dough between risings. Instead, it just takes "a very long fermentation time instead of kneading to form the gluten strands that give the bread its texture" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-knead_bread)).
